title: "Export Material\nSchedule"

tooltip: >
  Generates a procurement-ready material list from the Revit model
  based on defined material compositions of items.

  Unlike a BOQ, which measures works (e.g. walls or slabs),
  this tool produces a list of materials required to execute
  those works, such as cement, blocks, sand, aggregates, etc.

  Includes:
  - Aggregated material quantities from all model elements
  - Standard units of measurement (m, m², m³, No., kg, etc.)
  - Quantities suitable for ordering and procurement
