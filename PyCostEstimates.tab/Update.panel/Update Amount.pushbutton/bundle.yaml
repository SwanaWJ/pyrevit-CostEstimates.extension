title: "Compute\nAmount"

tooltip: >
  Computes the amount for each item or material by multiplying
  the extracted model quantity with the applied unit rate
  (Quantity × Unit Rate).

  The calculated value is written back into the model as a new
  parameter named "Amount", embedded within the family or
  constituent material.

  Displays a summary of how many families or items were updated,
  providing quick feedback on the scope of the operation.

  Useful for validating quantities, rates, and resulting costs
  directly within Revit, without generating a BOQ or exporting data.
