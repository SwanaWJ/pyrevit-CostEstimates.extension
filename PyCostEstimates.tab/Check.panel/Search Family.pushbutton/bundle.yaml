title: "Search\nFamily Type"

tooltip: >
  Searches the model for a specified family type name and
  highlights all matching instances.

  This tool helps confirm whether a particular family type
  exists in the model and where it has been used, reducing
  errors caused by missing, renamed, or incorrectly assumed
  family types.

  Useful during modelling QA, type validation, and before
  BOQ or cost calculations.
