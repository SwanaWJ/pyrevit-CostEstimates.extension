title: "Rename Family\nTypes"

tooltip: >
  Allows users to rename existing family types in the model
  using pre-built build-up or composition names from a CSV file.

  This tool helps standardise family naming by applying
  predefined rate or build-up descriptions, avoiding the need
  to create new families and saving significant modelling time.

  Each build-up name can only be used once, preventing
  duplicate assignments and maintaining data integrity
  across the model.
